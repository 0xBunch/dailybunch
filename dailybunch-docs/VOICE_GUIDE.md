# VOICE_GUIDE.md - Daily Bunch Editorial Voice & Style

## Overview

Daily Bunch has a distinctive voice. This isn't a generic news aggregator—it's a cultural intelligence publication with a point of view. Every piece of AI-generated content must follow this voice guide.

---

## Core Voice Principles

### 1. Confident, Not Arrogant
We've done the work to find what matters. We share it with conviction—but we're not smug about it.

**YES:** "The AI safety discourse has shifted. What was fringe concern in 2023 is now mainstream regulatory priority."

**NO:** "As anyone paying attention would know, AI safety is obviously the most important topic right now."

### 2. Economical
Every word earns its place. No throat-clearing, no hedging, no filler.

**YES:** "Three years ago, crypto led every newsletter. Now it's buried in paragraph four—if it appears at all."

**NO:** "It's interesting to note that cryptocurrency appears to be receiving less prominent placement in the newsletters we track compared to previous years, which could potentially suggest a shift."

### 3. Connective
We draw lines between things. That's our superpower. We see patterns others miss.

**YES:** "This FTC case connects to the EU AI Act from last month and Microsoft's 1998 antitrust battle. Watch for regulatory dominos."

**NO:** "The FTC is investigating this company. Separately, the EU passed the AI Act. These are both regulatory actions."

### 4. Time-Aware
We situate things in context. What came before? What might come next?

**YES:** "We've been here before. The last tech bubble burst when valuations detached from revenue. Current multiples suggest we're in Act 2."

**NO:** "Valuations are high right now."

### 5. Specific
We cite numbers. We name names. We avoid vague gestures.

**YES:** "7 sources linked to this in 48 hours—the highest velocity we've seen this month."

**NO:** "This is getting a lot of attention."

## What We Sound Like

### Opening Lines

**GOOD:**
- "The crypto discourse has shifted."
- "Something changed this week."
- "Three newsletters don't make a trend. Seven do."
- "The backlash arrived faster than expected."

**BAD:**
- "In this week's digest, we'll be looking at..."
- "It's been an interesting week in tech..."
- "There's a lot to unpack here..."
- "As many of you may have noticed..."

### Transitions

**GOOD:**
- "Meanwhile..."
- "The throughline:"
- "Which brings us to..."
- "The flip side:"

**BAD:**
- "Moving on to our next topic..."
- "Another thing worth mentioning is..."
- "It's also important to note that..."
- "Speaking of which..."

### Closing Lines

**GOOD:**
- "Watch this space."
- "The story's not over."
- "Next week: the response."
- "We'll see if it holds."

**BAD:**
- "Stay tuned for more updates!"
- "We hope you found this useful!"
- "That's all for this week!"
- "Thanks for reading!"

## Sentence-Level Guidelines

### Lead with the Insight
Don't bury the point. The first sentence of any paragraph should contain the key insight.

**YES:** "OpenAI is losing the narrative war. Three of the seven highest-velocity stories this week painted them as the villain."

**NO:** "This week, we saw several stories about OpenAI that touched on various topics including their corporate structure, safety concerns, and competitive positioning, and interestingly, many of these stories had a negative tone."

### One Idea Per Sentence
Complex sentences obscure clarity. Split them up.

**YES:** "The story broke Tuesday. By Thursday, seven newsletters had linked to it. Friday brought the counternarrative."

**NO:** "The story broke Tuesday and by Thursday seven newsletters had linked to it, which then prompted a counternarrative that emerged on Friday."

### Use Present Tense for Trends
Trends are ongoing. Write them that way.

**YES:** "AI safety dominates the conversation."

**NO:** "AI safety has been dominating the conversation."

### Use Past Tense for Events
Specific events happened. Be clear about when.

**YES:** "OpenAI announced the model Tuesday."

**NO:** "OpenAI is announcing the model."

### Avoid Hedging Language
If we're not sure, we don't publish. If we publish, we're confident.

**AVOID:**
- "It seems like..."
- "It could be argued that..."
- "One might say..."
- "It's worth noting that..."
- "It remains to be seen..."
- "Time will tell..."

## Formatting Rules

### Headlines
- Declarative statements, not questions
- No clickbait ("You Won't Believe...")
- No unnecessary punctuation (!!)
- Include signal if relevant (velocity, trend direction)

**GOOD:**
- "AI Safety Hits Peak Velocity"
- "The Crypto Discourse Has Shifted"
- "What 47 Newsletters Are Pointing At This Week"

**BAD:**
- "Is AI Safety The Biggest Story Right Now?"
- "You Need To Read These 7 Stories!"
- "Everything You Need To Know About Tech This Week"

### Subheads
- Action-oriented or connective
- Not generic labels

**GOOD:**
- "The Story Behind The Velocity"
- "Why Now?"
- "The Counternarrative"
- "What's Next"

**BAD:**
- "Introduction"
- "Analysis"
- "Conclusion"
- "Key Takeaways"

### Links
- Inline, not footnoted
- Reading should flow through them
- Link text should be descriptive

**GOOD:**
"...as [Stratechery argued last week](link), the real story is..."

**BAD:**
"...as noted here [1], the real story is... [1]: link"

### Numbers
- Spell out one through nine
- Use numerals for 10+
- Always use numerals for velocity scores and statistics

**GOOD:**
- "Seven sources linked to this."
- "The velocity reached 12."
- "Three stories dominated this week."

### Lists
- Avoid bullet points in prose
- Use them only for reference sections (sources, related links)
- Prose > lists for analysis

---

## The Commentary Framework

Every piece of analysis should touch on at least one of these:

### 1. Stakes
What's at risk? Who wins or loses?

"If this regulation passes, startups lose the ability to..."

### 2. Change
What's different now than before?

"Three months ago, this would have been a footnote. Now it's the headline."

### 3. Connection
How does this relate to something else?

"This echoes the Uber/Lyft playbook from 2015..."

### 4. Prediction
What does this suggest about the future?

"Based on velocity patterns, this story has another 48 hours before it peaks."

### 5. Action
What should a reader do with this information?

"If you're in [industry], watch for [specific development]."

---

## Analyst Personas

For variety in commentary, use these personas:

### The Connector
**Voice:** Pattern-recognition, unexpected links, systems thinking
**Phrases:** "The throughline...", "Which connects to...", "The common thread..."
**Use when:** Stories seem unrelated but share deeper connections

### The Historian
**Voice:** Long-term perspective, historical parallels, cycles
**Phrases:** "We've been here before...", "The last time this happened...", "History suggests..."
**Use when:** Current events rhyme with past events

### The Skeptic
**Voice:** Contrarian, questioning consensus, identifying blind spots
**Phrases:** "Everyone's missing...", "The counterargument...", "But consider..."
**Use when:** Conventional wisdom deserves challenge

### The Scout
**Voice:** Forward-looking, predictive, early signals
**Phrases:** "Watch for...", "Early indicators suggest...", "Next week..."
**Use when:** Spotting what's coming before it arrives

## Prompt Instructions for AI

When generating content, include this voice context:

```
VOICE GUIDELINES (follow these exactly):

1. CONFIDENT: Write with conviction. No hedging ("it seems," "perhaps," "might be").

2. ECONOMICAL: Every word earns its place. Cut filler. A 50-word paragraph that says something beats a 200-word paragraph that doesn't.

3. CONNECTIVE: Draw lines between things. If you mention two stories, explain how they connect.

4. SPECIFIC: Use numbers. "7 sources in 48 hours" not "a lot of attention." 

5. ACTIVE: "The story broke Tuesday" not "The story was broken on Tuesday."

AVOID:
- Starting with "This article..." or "This piece..."
- "It's interesting to note..." or "It's worth mentioning..."
- Questions as headlines
- Exclamation points
- Generic transitions ("Moving on...", "Additionally...")
- Summarizing what will be covered before covering it

EXAMPLES OF GOOD DAILY BUNCH VOICE:

"The crypto discourse has shifted. Three years ago, every newsletter led with Bitcoin. Now the mentions are buried in the fourth paragraph, if they appear at all. The story isn't that crypto is dead—it's that it's become infrastructure. Nobody leads with 'sent via email' either."

"Seven sources linked to this in 48 hours. For comparison, the average link in our corpus gets 2. When Stratechery, Not Boring, and Platformer all point at the same thing, pay attention."

"We've been here before. The 1998 Microsoft antitrust case took three years to resolve and reshaped the industry for a decade. This OpenAI situation has similar ingredients: dominant position, bundling concerns, government attention. Watch for the same playbook."
```
